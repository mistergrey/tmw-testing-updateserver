How to setup an Updateserver for TMW-EA
- Date 23rd of August 2012

This README will explain how to set up an Updateserver. It won't explain how to issue updates.

First of all you have to download the createupdates.lua. Then you have to modify the createupdates binbash script.
WORLD_DATA_REPOSITORY has to point to the .git dir of your client-data repository.
CLIENT_UPDATE_DIR is where the zips which this script creates will be put.

When this is done you have to check whether all the files which should be included in the basis are listed in the script. 
Therefore check below "local packages = {".
Once this is done you have to install adler32. You have to build adler32 out of the adler32.c. 
I used "cc adler32.c -lz -o adler32" to build it. Once you have the adler32 move it to /usr/bin.

Now type chmod +x createupdates and execute it with ./createupdate
Everything should be in place now and you should have a few zips in the CLIENT_UPDATE_DIR.
Uploade those to your webserver and link your server to that adress. Don't forget to add a news.txt.
